# BreadShield

BreadShield is a shield that maps Arduino pins to breadboard ties without jumper wires. It inserts into both of them, firmly bridging them together mechanically and electrically.

# Why

Many projects start with connecting an Arduino and a breadboard using jumper wires. But jumper wires can easily become too many to manage, forming a mess of spaghetti that is difficult to trace, debug, and swap:

#Introducing BreadShield: The Arduino shield for breadboards

Like you, we have suffered enough. One day we asked, what if all of those messy jumper wires could become one shield? So BreadShield was born. With BreadShield, the messy project above can be simplified into:

# No more choosing between shields or breadboards

Before, you cannot use shields together with breadboards because the jumper wires occupy sockets for shields. No more! With BreadShield, you can use both, simultaneously:
